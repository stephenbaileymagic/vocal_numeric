This project will use responsible AI practices in its creation and execution. This document will be home for the thoughts and considerations on this topic.


In the TinyML edX course it is recommended to consider Human Centered Design when creating any ML application.
The Human Centered Design frame work consists in part of several questions to consider when begining the design process. These questions will be addressed below.

1. What am I building?
 - A utility component using keyword recognition of numbers which can be incorporated into devices which require numerical input providing additional functionality.
 
2. Who am I building this for?
 - As a utility device this is intended to be useful to as many people as possible. Current number input devices can be used by most people so it must be at least this useful. If this works well it may provide additional utility to those who have issues with current input devices such as those who have trouble with their sight or dexterity. However, until this device can be proven in the field, it cannot guarantee utility beyond current applications of the device to which it is incorporated.
 
 3. What are the consequences if this device fails?
  - As this is not intended to be the sole input device of a system the cost of failure will not be highly significant to the user, an annoyance at worst. The device will be optimized to favor false negatives rather than false positives as it is believed that it is less annoying to say a number twice rather than have the device input the incorrect digit and have to edit the input.
  
  
The application phase of Human Centered Design introduces new questions which must be carefully considered in the creation of the device.

4. What data will be collected to train the model?
 - This project will use a hybrid approach using both publicly available data sets and data collected specifically for this project. This newly collected data will be similar to the public data sets in nature, but I must always consider the issues of anonymization, consent for use of the data and my data retention strategy to make sure nothing I'm doing in this project can have an unintended negative impact on the people who are helping me out. The fact that I am attempting to include under represented communities to make my project more robust and accessible make this especially important.
 
 5. How will data be collected?
  - The bulk of the data used in this project will be from publicly available datasets and will have been collected in accordance with the standards and techniques which they have previously set out. The new data collected will be in the form of in-person recordings made by myself. This will allow me to explain the way the data will be used and my data storage and retention plans to individuals before they decide if they wish to participate. I am also providing people with a link to the Mozilla Commmon Voice project if they do not wish to be recorded at the time and might wish to add thier voice in the future. This will limit the number of new people who I can include in this project, but I believe it will offer my best ability to gain informed consent and to make sure people understand what they are participating in.
  
  6. How will the data be stored/protected?
  - The voice data will be stored in two places. The first is my personal computer which only I have access to, and the second is on the Edge Impulse servers which is necessary for the creation of the model. The data is anonymous with only myself knowing who made the recordings assuming I recognize the voice. There will be no other identifiers associated with a specific recording. I am also considering deleting all of the data following the completion of this class project, however this will limit my ability to maintain/update the model in the future. Community feedback on this point is welcome.
