# vocal_numeric
The vocal_numeric project is a hardware/software emulation of 10 digit numeric keypad functionality using voice commands. The project has been created to participate in the TinyML edX class project competition. 

Goals:
1. To maximize learning by using concepts and procedures from the TinyML EdX course in practical application
2. To develop a utility device which combines hardware and ML voice command application software to emulate the function of a 10 digit keypad robustly and inexpensively
3. To win a prize in the competition

To achieve these goals, this project will:
1. Utilize readily available resources combined in creative, practical and novel ways
2. Follow development best practices outlined in the TinyML course including those for dataset development, responsible AI practices, and suggested workflows
3. Be open to collaborations which will expand and enrich this project


I am hopeful to also add examples of additional functionality which may be possible with this device by the competition deadline of August 31, 2021.

Thanks go to Vijay Reddi and the entire staff of the TinyML Edx course for providing the opportunity to participate in this competition.
